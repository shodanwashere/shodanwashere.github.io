Here are some lessons learned from James Clear's Atomic Habits. I'll be updating this post with new lessons as I go. Hopefully this will help you just as much as this book has been helping me. :)

## 1. intro to atomic habits
### 1.1. what are atomic habit?
- self-improvement is an investment, not a magic pill. you can't expect all your problems to be solved from one day to the other. if you keep improving, you will improve around 1% every day. you will not notice a 1% improvement you made yesterday, but you will notice a 30% improvement a month later, and you'll definitely notice a 365% improvement a year after. lesson: **have patience.**
- habits can be both good and bad, and you need to take note of details so you can control what habits to keep and which habits to leave.
- "atomic habits" aren't a buzzword - thought they are. atomic is a single unit of something, and atomic habits are single units of work in a system.
- people tend to strive towards goals, but goals are ephemeral. once you reach them, they're gone and there's nothing else to strive for. instead, you should strive towards building a working system. that system is made from atomic habits that lead your behavior and that behavior leads you to your goal. as you keep working and tweaking your system, you'll reach the goal you once desired, and ones you never thought of before. that's why goals aren't important. the process is.
### 1.2. how is our identity shaped by them?
- systems aren't a representation of what you want to achieve but of who you are as a person. therefore, you shouldn't think about what goals you want to achieve. instead, you should think about what kind of person you want to become.
- since systems are composed of habits, your habits also shape your identity. think about what kind of person you want to be, and think about the habits that kind of person should have and the ones they should avoid.
- change isn't single and definitive. it is continuous and ongoing. to become better, you will change, not just once, but multiple times.
### 1.3. how are habits build?
- habits are behaviors that have been repeated so many times in response to a certain situation that it becomes automatic - in the sense that your brain automates the response.
- the brain detects and transforms repeated behavior into habits to solve problems with little energy and effort. some are good, but some are bad. the brain is stupid and can't discern actual problems from bad common behavior.
- habits are formed through a feedback loop that involves a cue (a signal), a craving generated by that cue, a response to the situation and a reward as a result of the response. the reward can be tangible (physical) or intangible (psychological).
- thus, to create new habits, you need to make their cues obvious, their cravings attractive, their situational response easy to perform, and the reward to be satisfying. once you achieve these four conditions, repeated action of the habit feedback loop will rapidly wire your brain into creating that habit.

## 2. habit cues
### 2.1. habit cues and awareness
- as you go through your life, your brain already picks up on cues that predict certain outcomes subconsciously and automatically builds automated responses around them.
- this is why habits can be both a blessing and a curse: once they become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we're doing.
- to change our behavior, we need to be aware of it. to change our habits, we need to be aware of our habits.
- Japan uses a system called Pointing-and-Calling to make everyone on train stations aware of train, rail and station status before any further actions are taken, maximizing efficiency and avoiding accidents by pointing out errors and mistakes. it can also be used by us to be more conscious about unconscious habits we have by Pointing and Calling them out.
- a good way to further make use of P&C is making a habit scorecard: take note of all the habits you already have and rank them as positive (+), negative (-) or neutral (=). now you know which habits to maintain and which ones to start avoiding.
### 2.2. implementation intention and habit stacking
- if the 1st law of behavior change is "making habit cues obvious", then we need to make the cues related to habits we want to build obvious. the two most common are "time" and "place".
- implementation intention is a technique where you verbalize, take note, essentially register/implement your intention to do a certain action. you can use it to pair it with a time and place, and register those as a cue: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."
- habit stacking is another technique that helps you build habits, and is based - as the name implies - on stacking habits on top of each other, using habits you already currently do as cues for new habits you want to build: "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."
### 2.3. environmental & contextual cues
- situational context and the environment you're in substantially affect the way you behave. therefore, small changes in situations you live or changes in the environment around you can lead to big changes in your behavior over time.
- we can then infer that cues aren't just visual. they're contextual and environmental as well. your habits can stop being associated with a single trigger and slowly become associated with the very context surrounding the behavior (like associating drinking with not only going out with your friends, going out with your friends _to the bar_)
- make cues of good habits obvious in your environment so you can notice them more easily. if you want to practice the guitar, make it easily accessible. if you want to drink more water, make it noticeable and more accessible throughout your house. etc, etc.
- it's also suggested to build new habits in new environments. environments can be associated to situational contexts too, and those trigger cues of their own. so if you build new habits in new environments with no attached cuews, you won't be arm wrestling with old cues. (i.e., if you feel like you wanna play video games while you're trying to study where you always play video games, go study in another part of the house you don't usually go to)
### 2.4. cue-induced wanting -> how to break bad habits
- the first law of behavior change is used to build habits. we can infer that the inversion of the law would break habits. therefore, if we need to make habit cues obvious to build new habits, we should **make habit cues invisible to break old habits**.
- habits are hard to break because, once they're formed, they're hard to forget: "old habits die hard". however, hard isn't impossible to do.
- people will tell you that to break old habits you need to have more "self-control". this is bullshit. people with so-called "self-control" don't exactly have self-control, they just tend to spend less time in tempting situations. this is because self-control isn't that easy to implement. it's much easier to avoid temptation than to resist it.
- so, we avoid temptations, and thus, we must avoid temptational habit cues. we must reduce exposure to those cues that cause bad habits and thus make them "invisible".
- remember, always call bullshit on self-control. it is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. avoid temptation whenever possible and only resist it as a last resort.
